def subsample_indicator(indicator, num_samples):
    """Subsample indicator vector.

    Given a boolean indicator vector with M elements set to `True`, the function
    assigns all but `num_samples` of these previously `True` elements to
    `False`. If `num_samples` is greater than M, the original indicator vector
    is returned.

    Arguments:
    - *indicator*: a 1-dimensional boolean tensor indicating which elements
        are allowed to be sampled and which are not.

    - *num_samples*: int32 scalar tensor

    Returns:

    A boolean tensor with the same shape as input (indicator) tensor
